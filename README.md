# Animal_Shelter_Outcome
Predicting animal shelter outcomes based on a variety of factors.

### Roles: 
SQUARE: Chloe, TRIANGLE: Hussan, CIRCLE: Lexie
Chloe has taken the role of working on database connection, Hussan worked with cleaning the data and the machine learning model, and Lexie is creating the visualizations. All team members will split the role of the presentation and dashboarding. 

## Outline of Project 
Many animals end up in shelters for various reasons across the country. Therefore the goal of this project is to predict the likelyhood of a successful animal adoption based on an animals characteristics. 

#### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from kaggle and features both cats and dogs with various characteristics out of shelters in Austin Texas. In order to simplify this dataset, it is filtered to show just information on dogs. Columns that do not have much impact on the outcome are dropped (such as if they are neutured/spayed which occurs upon adoption). We also generated another dataset to provide the shelter information with more characteristics. 
- info on breed data
- the data cleaning process
- how we joined

#### Database
- the AWS connection

#### Machine Learning Model 
- The ML model 
- What we hope to achieve

#### Visualization
- The visualization.
